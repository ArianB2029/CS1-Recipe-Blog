  <img src="PumpkinPie2-2.jpg" width="200px">

  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Pumpkin pie is the best desert to have during the fall season, whether it be after a night of trick or treating, or during a Thanksgiving dinner.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/2 cup cold butter or shortening</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons cold water, or more as needed</li>
    <li>2 cups mashed, cooked pie pumpkin</li>
    <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
    <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
    <li>3/4 cup packed brown sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or more to taste</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger, or more to taste</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg, or more to taste</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
    <li>To make the pastry crust: Mix flour and salt together in a bowl. Cut in butter with a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
    <li>Mix in 3 tablespoons water, one at a time, until dough is moist enough to hold together. Add up to 1 more tablespoon water if needed.</li>
    <li>Shape dough into a ball with lightly floured hands. Roll dough on a lightly floured surface to a thickness of 1/8 inch.</li>
    <li>Place a 9-inch pie pan upside-down on the dough; use a sharp knife to cut a circle of dough 1 ½ inches larger than the pie pan. Remove and discard dough scraps and set pie pan aside.</li>
    <li>Gently roll circular piece of dough around the rolling pin; transfer it right-side up over the pie pan. Unroll, easing dough into the bottom of the pan.</li>
    <li>Use two hands to flute the dough around the top edges.</li>
    <li>To make the filling: Beat pumpkin, evaporated milk, brown sugar, eggs, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and salt in a large bowl with an electric mixer until well combined. Pour into the prepared crust.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the filling 1 inch from the edge comes out clean, 40 to 60 minutes. Cover the edges with foil if needed to prevent from burning as the filling cooks.</li>
    <li>Remove from the oven and cool to room temperature before serving.</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>

  <img src="Pasta.webp" width="400px">

  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Other than the turkey, this pasta is the dish that most of the people at the dinner table are looking forward to on Thanksgiving. Its creamy pumpkin texture and its delicious sausagey goodness will make you want to go back for seconds.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 (16 ounce) package bow-tie pasta</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>1 pound bulk sweet Italian sausage</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
    <li>1 ¼ cups dry white wine</li>
    <li>1 ½ tablespoons rubbed sage</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups chicken stock</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups canned pumpkin</li>
    <li>¾ cup half-and-half</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
    <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a deep, nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Drain and discard grease.</li>
    <li>Heat teaspoon oil in the skillet. Add onion and garlic; saute until tender, 5 to 8 minutes. Drain pasta and return to the pot.</li>

Reduce heat and stir in half-and-half. Season sauce with cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Simmer until sauce thickens, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Pour pumpkin cream sauce over the pasta. Toss over low heat for 1 minute. Taste and adjust seasoning.</li>
