  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Pumpkin pie is the best desert to have during the fall season, whether it be after a night of trick or treating, or during a Thanksgiving dinner.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/2 cup cold butter or shortening</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons cold water, or more as needed</li>
    <li>2 cups mashed, cooked pie pumpkin</li>
    <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
    <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
    <li>3/4 cup packed brown sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or more to taste</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger, or more to taste</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg, or more to taste</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
    <li>To make the pastry crust: Mix flour and salt together in a bowl. Cut in butter with a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
    <li>Mix in 3 tablespoons water, one at a time, until dough is moist enough to hold together. Add up to 1 more tablespoon water if needed.</li>
    <li>Shape dough into a ball with lightly floured hands. Roll dough on a lightly floured surface to a thickness of 1/8 inch.</li>
    <li>Place a 9-inch pie pan upside-down on the dough; use a sharp knife to cut a circle of dough 1 Â½ inches larger than the pie pan. Remove and discard dough scraps and set pie pan aside.</li>
    <li>Gently roll circular piece of dough around the rolling pin; transfer it right-side up over the pie pan. Unroll, easing dough into the bottom of the pan.</li>
    <li>Use two hands to flute the dough around the top edges.</li>
    <li>To make the filling: Beat pumpkin, evaporated milk, brown sugar, eggs, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and salt in a large bowl with an electric mixer until well combined. Pour into the prepared crust.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the filling 1 inch from the edge comes out clean, 40 to 60 minutes. Cover the edges with foil if needed to prevent from burning as the filling cooks.</li>
    <li>Remove from the oven and cool to room temperature before serving.</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
